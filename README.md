## AutoScout Car Value Tracker
This project monitors the value of a specific car on the AutoScout website using Python. The data is scraped daily with Selenium, transformed, and stored in a MongoDB database. The data retrieval is automated using Apache Airflow, and a Flask application provides a REST API for accessing the stored data.
